% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the article.
\begin{abstract}

The aim of this work is to study the network of members of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, analyzing relations based on voting behaviors. \\
%We focus on the relations based on voting behaviors, and explore some basic aspects of the networks. \\
In particular, we analyze data of the XVII and XVIII legislatures of the Italian Parliament.\\

After a general description of the network, we focus our attention on communities emerging from voting similarities, asking ourselves how the distinction in parties actively influences voting behaviors.\\
%We then try to develop a strategy to predict the formation of new links based on previous history of the network.\\
We then analyse the network evolution over time, using monthly data as temporal snapshot to build a stream graph.\\
Finally, we want to address the following open question: "Using voting data of the Chamber of Deputies, can we detect some signals pointing out to an imminent government crisis?".\footnote{
