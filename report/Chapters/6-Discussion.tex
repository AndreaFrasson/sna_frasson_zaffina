\section{Discussion}

Our dataset is composed of 107 graphs, one for each month. We want to embed those graphs based on their structural properties, in such a way so that they are linearly separable.\\
Each graph is given a label: '1' if it corresponds to a month of crisis, and '0' otherwise.\\

The data is divided into two datasets: a training set, which contains the first 89 months, and a test set, containing the remaining 28.\\
